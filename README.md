# Irish-Autonomous-XLE

This project constitutes a grammar fragment for the Irish language, focused on constructions involving the autonomous form of the verb. The grammar is based in the formalism of Lexical-Functional Grammar and is written for the Xerox Linguistic Environment. The grammar generates LFG analyses for sentences given as input.
